# Localization
An alternative way to translate and localize your Delphi application

There are many ways to translate an application, Delphi has also an integrated solution. For my needs it was to overloaded and may lead to some confusions with the cloned and inherited DFM files. 

I was looking for a simlpier solution. For open source projects it is an advantage, when the strings are stored in simple text files. Anyone, mostly convinced users, are then able to dig in and correct or create a whole translation.
